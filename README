# EASY IMAGE
## Description
Some scripts JSX make you more easy for modify those images in PHOTOSHOP.

- **PNGs to PNG**: Merge PNGs in one layer only sequentially.
    - Import the action's script **crop.atn** in PHOTOSHOP before the execution.
    - Those PNGs have to need the same dimension(Width x Height).
- **GIF to PNG**: Merge all layer sequentially.

## Requirement
Before your JSX execution, you should open the PHOTOSHOP application in first place.

## Run
You can use any APP for run JSX, for example, I'm using the plugin of VScode: **ExtendScript Debugger**
